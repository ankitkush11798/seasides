    fullDescription:
      'The modern attack surface now spans the entire software supply chain, covering everything from source code and CI/CD pipelines to dependencies, registries, and distribution systems. This expanded exposure has made supply chain attacks one of the top three risks in the OWASP Top 10.\n\nIn this workshop, participants will look at real case studies, including recent npm attacks, and learn how attackers take advantage of weak points in the software supply chain. To help defend against these risks, attendees will learn how to create and understand SBOMs, sign important artifacts, and set up strong checks to make sure every part of their software pipeline is verified and trustworthy.\n\nFull Technical Details\nThis workshop provides a practical and technical understanding of how modern software is built, the components involved, and where supply chain risks emerge. We cover source control, CI/CD, dependencies, containers, cloud integrations, and AI-related risks. Using recent incidents like the s1ngularity and Shai-Hulud attacks, we show how malicious packages execute during builds, steal credentials, and bypass common detection gaps.\n\nParticipants will perform offensive exercises, including exploiting dependency confusion by publishing a malicious package and analysing vulnerable SBOMs using depconfuse. We demonstrate how secrets are exposed through hardcoded credentials, long-lived AWS IAM keys in GitHub, bypassing GitHub’s secret masking, and exfiltrating secrets with a malicious PR. We then explain how organisations can prevent this using GitHub OIDC.\n\nThe workshop also covers repojacking and typesquatting attacks, showing how renamed or deleted repos and lookalike package names are abused, along with methods to detect these threats.\n\nOn the defence side, we teach SBOM fundamentals (CycloneDX and SPDX), key fields, and the differences between flat and transitive SBOMs, followed by generating an SBOM in a hands-on lab. We also cover signing code, artifacts, SBOMs, and container images using cosign. Finally, we explain the SLSA framework and practical controls teams can adopt to strengthen software supply chain security.',

You start in a low trust office network with a couple of Linux machines and then pivot into the main office segment that holds the Windows systems and the full AD setup. The lab mirrors what you would see in an actual internal environment with realistic users, internal machines, and practical misconfigurations.\n\nThroughout the training, you will work through core AD attacks like Kerberoasting, credential leaks, certificate abuse, lateral movement, and DCsync style techniques. You begin with limited access, move deeper step by step, and follow a real red team workflow covering enumeration, escalation, pivoting, and internal movement until you reach Domain Admin and understand how a full AD compromise actually plays out.\n\nParticipant Limit: 40–50 participants to ensure effective training delivery.',

This expanded exposure has made supply chain attacks one of the top three risks in the OWASP Top 10.\n\nIn this workshop, participants will look at real case studies, including recent npm attacks, and learn how attackers take advantage of weak points in the software supply chain. To help defend against these risks, attendees will learn how to create and understand SBOMs, sign important artifacts, and set up strong checks to make sure every part of their software pipeline is verified and trustworthy.\n\nFull Technical Details\nThis workshop provides a practical and technical understanding of how modern software is built, the components involved, and where supply chain risks emerge. We cover source control, CI/CD, dependencies, containers, cloud integrations, and AI-related risks. Using recent incidents like the s1ngularity and Shai-Hulud attacks, we show how malicious packages execute during builds, steal credentials, and bypass common detection gaps.\n\nParticipants will perform offensive exercises, including exploiting dependency confusion by publishing a malicious package and analysing vulnerable SBOMs using depconfuse. We demonstrate how secrets are exposed through hardcoded credentials, long-lived AWS IAM keys in GitHub, bypassing GitHub’s secret masking, and exfiltrating secrets with a malicious PR. We then explain how organisations can prevent this using GitHub OIDC.\n\nThe workshop also covers repojacking and typesquatting attacks, showing how renamed or deleted repos and lookalike package names are abused, along with methods to detect these threats.\n\nOn the defence side, we teach SBOM fundamentals (CycloneDX and SPDX), key fields, and the differences between flat and transitive SBOMs, followed by generating an SBOM in a hands-on lab. We also cover signing code, artifacts, SBOMs, and container images using cosign. Finally, we explain the SLSA framework and practical controls teams can adopt to strengthen software supply chain security.',

From autonomous decision-making systems to large-scale data analytics, today’s technologies are testing traditional governance models and redefining what responsible leadership looks like in a hyperconnected world.\n\nThis panel explores how executive leaders can navigate the evolving intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and data privacy while maintaining stakeholder trust. Panelists will examine leadership accountability in the face of AI-enabled threats, regulatory uncertainty, and rising public expectations around transparency and data stewardship. Key themes include embedding trust into AI strategy, aligning cyber resilience with business outcomes, responding to breaches in an era of reputational immediacy, and fostering a culture where ethical AI and privacy-by-design are leadership imperatives rather than technical afterthoughts.\n\nDesigned for senior decision-makers, this discussion will offer practical insights on how trust can be operationalized as a strategic asset - and how leadership actions today will determine organizational credibility, resilience, and long-term value in an AI-driven future.',
