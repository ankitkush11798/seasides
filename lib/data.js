    fullDescription:
      'The modern attack surface now spans the entire software supply chain, covering everything from source code and CI/CD pipelines to dependencies, registries, and distribution systems. This expanded exposure has made supply chain attacks one of the top three risks in the OWASP Top 10.\n\nIn this workshop, participants will look at real case studies, including recent npm attacks, and learn how attackers take advantage of weak points in the software supply chain. To help defend against these risks, attendees will learn how to create and understand SBOMs, sign important artifacts, and set up strong checks to make sure every part of their software pipeline is verified and trustworthy.\n\nFull Technical Details\nThis workshop provides a practical and technical understanding of how modern software is built, the components involved, and where supply chain risks emerge. We cover source control, CI/CD, dependencies, containers, cloud integrations, and AI-related risks. Using recent incidents like the s1ngularity and Shai-Hulud attacks, we show how malicious packages execute during builds, steal credentials, and bypass common detection gaps.\n\nParticipants will perform offensive exercises, including exploiting dependency confusion by publishing a malicious package and analysing vulnerable SBOMs using depconfuse. We demonstrate how secrets are exposed through hardcoded credentials, long-lived AWS IAM keys in GitHub, bypassing GitHub’s secret masking, and exfiltrating secrets with a malicious PR. We then explain how organisations can prevent this using GitHub OIDC.\n\nThe workshop also covers repojacking and typesquatting attacks, showing how renamed or deleted repos and lookalike package names are abused, along with methods to detect these threats.\n\nOn the defence side, we teach SBOM fundamentals (CycloneDX and SPDX), key fields, and the differences between flat and transitive SBOMs, followed by generating an SBOM in a hands-on lab. We also cover signing code, artifacts, SBOMs, and container images using cosign. Finally, we explain the SLSA framework and practical controls teams can adopt to strengthen software supply chain security.',

This expanded exposure has made supply chain attacks one of the top three risks in the OWASP Top 10.\n\nIn this workshop, participants will look at real case studies, including recent npm attacks, and learn how attackers take advantage of weak points in the software supply chain. To help defend against these risks, attendees will learn how to create and understand SBOMs, sign important artifacts, and set up strong checks to make sure every part of their software pipeline is verified and trustworthy.',

        'The modern attack surface now spans the entire software supply chain, covering everything from source code and CI/CD pipelines to dependencies, registries, and distribution systems. This expanded exposure has made supply chain attacks one of the top three risks in the OWASP Top 10.\n\nIn this workshop, participants will look at real case studies, including recent npm attacks, and learn how attackers take advantage of weak points in the software supply chain. To help defend against these risks, attendees will learn how to create and understand SBOMs, sign important artifacts, and set up strong checks to make sure every part of their software pipeline is verified and trustworthy.\n\nFull Technical Details\nThis workshop provides a practical and technical understanding of how modern software is built, the components involved, and where supply chain risks emerge. We cover source control, CI/CD, dependencies, containers, cloud integrations, and AI-related risks. Using recent incidents like the s1ngularity and Shai-Hulud attacks, we show how malicious packages execute during builds, steal credentials, and bypass common detection gaps.\n\nParticipants will perform offensive exercises, including exploiting dependency confusion by publishing a malicious package and analysing vulnerable SBOMs using depconfuse. We demonstrate how secrets are exposed through hardcoded credentials, long-lived AWS IAM keys in GitHub, bypassing GitHub’s secret masking, and exfiltrating secrets with a malicious PR. We then explain how organisations can prevent this using GitHub OIDC.\n\nThe workshop also covers repojacking and typesquatting attacks, showing how renamed or deleted repos and lookalike package names are abused, along with methods to detect these threats.\n\nOn the defence side, we teach SBOM fundamentals (CycloneDX and SPDX), key fields, and the differences between flat and transitive SBOMs, followed by generating an SBOM in a hands-on lab. We also cover signing code, artifacts, SBOMs, and container images using cosign. Finally, we explain the SLSA framework and practical controls teams can adopt to strengthen software supply chain security.',

        'This session explores how browser extensions can be used to simulate real-world attack scenarios inside modern enterprise environments. Participants will learn how extensions fit into the browser’s architecture, why their permissions provide powerful control over user sessions, and how attackers can leverage them for input interception, content manipulation, session abuse, and authorization tampering. The training includes demonstrations of ten extension-based attack techniques and a practical walkthrough on designing and customizing extension modules for red team use. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how browser-level simulations reveal gaps in enterprise defenses and how to safely build their own tools for controlled offensive testing.',

        "Learning Sigma detection rules is critical for modern security professionals because it\nprovides a vendor-agnostic, standardized format for describing log-based security alerts. This\nuniversal approach allows a security team to write a detection rule once and then translate and\ndeploy it across various Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and log\nanalysis platforms, effectively fighting vendor lock-in and dramatically streamlining\noperations. By leveraging the large, open-source community repository of Sigma rules,\nanalysts can rapidly deploy detection logic for emerging threats and new adversary tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) without having to wait for specific vendor updates, fostering\nglobal collaboration and significantly enhancing an organization's overall threat visibility and\ndetection engineering efficiency.",

Participants will start with the basics of search engines, then learn how to pivot from IOCs like domains, IPs, and certificates to uncover related hosts. The session also covers reading GitHub source code to extract network indicators and create queries that identify live C2 servers. Through guided labs, you’ll practice turning IOCs into searches, analyzing results, and documenting hunts. By the end, you’ll be able to build repeatable workflows for discovering C2 infrastructure safely and effectively.',

Each red-team step is paired with a measurable blue-team defense, plus supply-chain verification and practical detection strategies.',

        'Red Teaming On Steroids Breaking into AD is an intermediate, hands-on training built around a realistic company environment called ZenithCorp, hosted on Enciphers’ VantagePoint platform. You start in a low trust office network with a couple of Linux machines and then pivot into the main office segment that holds the Windows systems and the full AD setup. The lab mirrors what you would see in an actual internal environment with realistic users, internal machines, and practical misconfigurations.\n\nThroughout the training, you will work through core AD attacks like Kerberoasting, credential leaks, certificate abuse, lateral movement, and DCsync style techniques. You begin with limited access, move deeper step by step, and follow a real red team workflow covering enumeration, escalation, pivoting, and internal movement until you reach Domain Admin and understand how a full AD compromise actually plays out.\n\nParticipant Limit: 40–50 participants to ensure effective training delivery.',
