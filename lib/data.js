To help defend against these risks, attendees will learn how to create and understand SBOMs, sign important artifacts, and set up strong checks to make sure every part of their software pipeline is verified and trustworthy.\n\nFull Technical Details\nThis workshop provides a practical and technical understanding of how modern software is built, the components involved, and where supply chain risks emerge. We cover source control, CI/CD, dependencies, containers, cloud integrations, and AI-related risks. Using recent incidents like the s1ngularity and Shai-Hulud attacks, we show how malicious packages execute during builds, steal credentials, and bypass common detection gaps.\n\nParticipants will perform offensive exercises, including exploiting dependency confusion by publishing a malicious package and analysing vulnerable SBOMs using depconfuse. We demonstrate how secrets are exposed through hardcoded credentials, long-lived AWS IAM keys in GitHub, bypassing GitHub’s secret masking, and exfiltrating secrets with a malicious PR. We then explain how organisations can prevent this using GitHub OIDC.\n\nThe workshop also covers repojacking and typesquatting attacks, showing how renamed or deleted repos and lookalike package names are abused, along with methods to detect these threats.\n\nOn the defence side, we teach SBOM fundamentals (CycloneDX and SPDX), key fields, and the differences between flat and transitive SBOMs, followed by generating an SBOM in a hands-on lab. We also cover signing code, artifacts, SBOMs, and container images using cosign. Finally, we explain the SLSA framework and practical controls teams can adopt to strengthen software supply chain security.',

The course begins by establishing the foundations of DevSecOps in today’s AI-accelerated threat landscape, emphasizing how security must be embedded across the SDLC rather than treated as a final gate.\n\nParticipants will gain practical experience with Static Application Security Testing (SAST), including a hands-on lab that demonstrates how traditional SAST workflows can be augmented with AI to reduce false positives, accelerate triage, and improve developer usability.\n\nThe training then transitions into Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and supply-chain security, covering core concepts such as SBOMs, VEX, and CSAF. Through guided labs, attendees will generate and analyze SBOMs, interpret vulnerability and exploitability data, and apply AI techniques to streamline dependency risk assessment.\n\nIn the second half of the day, the focus shifts to Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). Participants will learn DAST fundamentals, complete a mini-workshop using OWASP ZAP, and explore how AI can assist in scan optimization, result interpretation, and reporting.\n\nThe day concludes with a dedicated module on LLM Security, introducing the OWASP Top 10 for LLM applications. Attendees will perform hands-on red teaming of large language models using Promptfoo, learning how to identify prompt injection, data leakage, and jailbreak risks, while understanding emerging defensive patterns for securing AI systems.\n\nBy the end of the day, participants will have a practical, end-to-end understanding of how SAST, SCA, DAST, and LLM security can be integrated into DevSecOps pipelines using AI to improve speed, accuracy, and security outcomes.',

This\nuniversal approach allows a security team to write a detection rule once and then translate and\ndeploy it across various Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and log\nanalysis platforms, effectively fighting vendor lock-in and dramatically streamlining\noperations. By leveraging the large, open-source community repository of Sigma rules,\nanalysts can rapidly deploy detection logic for emerging threats and new adversary tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) without having to wait for specific vendor updates, fostering\nglobal collaboration and significantly enhancing an organization's overall threat visibility and\ndetection engineering efficiency.",

This expanded exposure has made supply chain attacks one of the top three risks in the OWASP Top 10.\n\nIn this workshop, participants will look at real case studies, including recent npm attacks, and learn how attackers take advantage of weak points in the software supply chain. To help defend against these risks, attendees will learn how to create and understand SBOMs, sign important artifacts, and set up strong checks to make sure every part of their software pipeline is verified and trustworthy.\n\nFull Technical Details\nThis workshop provides a practical and technical understanding of how modern software is built, the components involved, and where supply chain risks emerge. We cover source control, CI/CD, dependencies, containers, cloud integrations, and AI-related risks. Using recent incidents like the s1ngularity and Shai-Hulud attacks, we show how malicious packages execute during builds, steal credentials, and bypass common detection gaps.\n\nParticipants will perform offensive exercises, including exploiting dependency confusion by publishing a malicious package and analysing vulnerable SBOMs using depconfuse. We demonstrate how secrets are exposed through hardcoded credentials, long-lived AWS IAM keys in GitHub, bypassing GitHub’s secret masking, and exfiltrating secrets with a malicious PR. We then explain how organisations can prevent this using GitHub OIDC.\n\nThe workshop also covers repojacking and typesquatting attacks, showing how renamed or deleted repos and lookalike package names are abused, along with methods to detect these threats.\n\nOn the defence side, we teach SBOM fundamentals (CycloneDX and SPDX), key fields, and the differences between flat and transitive SBOMs, followed by generating an SBOM in a hands-on lab. We also cover signing code, artifacts, SBOMs, and container images using cosign. Finally, we explain the SLSA framework and practical controls teams can adopt to strengthen software supply chain security.',

        'Audience:\nDevelopers, security engineers, red teamers, QA/security champions, and product owners who want hands-on experience in testing and securing LLM-powered applications.\n\nGoal:\nProvide a practical, attack-and-defend learning experience using AIGoat tool built by us to learn AI security, a purpose-built lab for AI security. Attendees will understand the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, perform real adversarial tests, and implement developer-friendly mitigations in live exercises.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n• Recognize how AI/LLM systems expand the attack surface.\n• Map vulnerabilities to OWASP LLM Top 10 and see them in action.\n• Perform red-team style attacks (prompt injection, jailbreaks, data poisoning, sensitive data leakage) directly in AIGoat.\n• Implement guardrails: input/output validation, memory isolation, secret splitting, capability segmentation, monitoring.\n• Learn how to integrate attack simulations and mitigations into CI/CD pipelines.\n• Apply skills in a Capture-the-Flag competition modeled on real-world scenarios.\n\nTraining Approach:\nThis two-day workshop blends short lectures, live demos, and labs inside AIGoat. Day 1 & 2 focuses on attacking AI systems, emphasizes defenses, mitigations, and ends with a CTF to cement learning.\n\nTakeaways:\n• Hands-On Understanding of OWASP LLM Top 10: Experience each vulnerability category in a safe lab and learn how attackers exploit them.\n• Red-Team Skills for AI Systems: Practice prompt injection, jailbreaks, data poisoning, and sensitive data leakage using AIGoat scenarios.\n• Defensive Guardrail Patterns: Learn concrete mitigations including input/output filters, sandboxing, memory isolation, capability segmentation, and secret-splitting.\n• Risk Assessment Framework: Get a ready-to-use checklist for evaluating LLM/AI-powered applications before production release.\n• Incident Prevention Mindset: Shift from reactive to proactive security with attacker-mindset testing and automated guardrails.\n• Ethical Hacking Skills Transferable to Work: Practice on AIGoat to build confidence applying these tests safely within your own environment.\n• Capture-the-Flag Experience: Conclude the workshop with a CTF challenge simulating real-world AI security attacks and defenses.\n• Reusable Playbook & Tools: Walk away with an AIGoat lab Setup, a guardrail playbook, and a red-team checklist to use back at work.',
