      'Audience:\nDevelopers, security engineers, red teamers, QA/security champions, and product owners who want hands-on experience in testing and securing LLM-powered applications.\n\nGoal:\nProvide a practical, attack-and-defend learning experience using AIGoat (https://github.com/AISecurityConsortium/AIGoat) tool built by us to learn AI security, a purpose-built lab for AI security. Attendees will understand the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, perform real adversarial tests, and implement developer-friendly mitigations in live exercises.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n• Recognize how AI/LLM systems expand the attack surface.\n• Map vulnerabilities to OWASP LLM Top 10 and see them in action.\n• Perform red-team style attacks (prompt injection, jailbreaks, data poisoning, sensitive data leakage) directly in AIGoat.\n• Implement guardrails: input/output validation, memory isolation, secret splitting, capability segmentation, monitoring.\n• Learn how to integrate attack simulations and mitigations into CI/CD pipelines.\n• Apply skills in a Capture-the-Flag competition modeled on real-world scenarios.\n\nTraining Approach:\nThis two-day workshop blends short lectures, live demos, and labs inside AIGoat. Day 1 & 2 focuses on attacking AI systems, emphasizes defenses, mitigations, and ends with a CTF to cement learning.\n\nTakeaways:\n• Hands-On Understanding of OWASP LLM Top 10: Experience each vulnerability category in a safe lab and learn how attackers exploit them.\n• Red-Team Skills for AI Systems: Practice prompt injection, jailbreaks, data poisoning, and sensitive data leakage using AIGoat scenarios.\n• Defensive Guardrail Patterns: Learn concrete mitigations including input/output filters, sandboxing, memory isolation, capability segmentation, and secret-splitting.\n• Risk Assessment Framework: Get a ready-to-use checklist for evaluating LLM/AI-powered applications before production release.\n• Incident Prevention Mindset: Shift from reactive to proactive security with attacker-mindset testing and automated guardrails.\n• Ethical Hacking Skills Transferable to Work: Practice on AIGoat to build confidence applying these tests safely within your own environment.\n• Capture-the-Flag Experience: Conclude the workshop with a CTF challenge simulating real-world AI security attacks and defenses.\n• Reusable Playbook & Tools: Walk away with an AIGoat lab Setup, a guardrail playbook, and a red-team checklist to use back at work.',

Through guided labs, attendees will generate and analyze SBOMs, interpret vulnerability and exploitability data, and apply AI techniques to streamline dependency risk assessment.\n\nIn the second half of the day, the focus shifts to Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). Participants will learn DAST fundamentals, complete a mini-workshop using OWASP ZAP, and explore how AI can assist in scan optimization, result interpretation, and reporting.\n\nThe day concludes with a dedicated module on LLM Security, introducing the OWASP Top 10 for LLM applications. Attendees will perform hands-on red teaming of large language models using Promptfoo, learning how to identify prompt injection, data leakage, and jailbreak risks, while understanding emerging defensive patterns for securing AI systems.\n\nBy the end of the day, participants will have a practical, end-to-end understanding of how SAST, SCA, DAST, and LLM security can be integrated into DevSecOps pipelines using AI to improve speed, accuracy, and security outcomes.',

Participants will learn how extensions fit into the browser’s architecture, why their permissions provide powerful control over user sessions, and how attackers can leverage them for input interception, content manipulation, session abuse, and authorization tampering. The training includes demonstrations of ten extension-based attack techniques and a practical walkthrough on designing and customizing extension modules for red team use. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how browser-level simulations reveal gaps in enterprise defenses and how to safely build their own tools for controlled offensive testing.',

        "Learning Sigma detection rules is critical for modern security professionals because it\nprovides a vendor-agnostic, standardized format for describing log-based security alerts. This\nuniversal approach allows a security team to write a detection rule once and then translate and\ndeploy it across various Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and log\nanalysis platforms, effectively fighting vendor lock-in and dramatically streamlining\noperations. By leveraging the large, open-source community repository of Sigma rules,\nanalysts can rapidly deploy detection logic for emerging threats and new adversary tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) without having to wait for specific vendor updates, fostering\nglobal collaboration and significantly enhancing an organization's overall threat visibility and\ndetection engineering efficiency.",

Participants will start with the basics of search engines, then learn how to pivot from IOCs like domains, IPs, and certificates to uncover related hosts. The session also covers reading GitHub source code to extract network indicators and create queries that identify live C2 servers. Through guided labs, you’ll practice turning IOCs into searches, analyzing results, and documenting hunts. By the end, you’ll be able to build repeatable workflows for discovering C2 infrastructure safely and effectively.',

Each red-team step is paired with a measurable blue-team defense, plus supply-chain verification and practical detection strategies.',
